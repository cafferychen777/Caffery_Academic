I am a junior majoring in Biostatistics at Southern Medical University. I am proud to have received the National Scholarship from the Ministry of Education of China in 2020-2021, an honor awarded to only 0.2% of China's top students each year.

I excel in mathematical modeling and have won numerous awards in national competitions. During my freshman year, I worked as a research assistant on a project that focused on grass-roots health quality assessment through standardized patients. Our findings have been put into practice and have made a positive impact on the field.

In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant at the Case Western Reserve University Center for Quantitative Medicine, under the supervision of Professor Liangliang Zhang. During my time there, I contributed to the development of an R package for processing microbiome data and gained experience in using Bayesian statistics for microbiome analysis.

I am currently seeking a summer internship for 2023 and a PhD position for fall 2023 in the field of Biostatistics or a related field. If you have any opportunities available, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
